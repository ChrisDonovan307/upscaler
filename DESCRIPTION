Description: Organizing code for large projects is challenging.
    This package provides functions for building useful sub-folders, creating
    a time-stamped log file, building separate function files with templates,
    constructing annotated .csv data files, quickly visualizing data and 
    statistically testing data with a set of \code{qplot} functions, and more. 
    Repetitive tasks in large projects can be batch-processed.
